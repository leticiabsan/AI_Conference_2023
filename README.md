# Material for The Artificial Inteligence in Orlando, FL 2023
 
This repository contains the code and sample (fake) datasets used in the ["PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP: AI IN AGRICULTURE: LET'S WRITE A MODERN THESIS!"](https://abe.ufl.edu/2023-ai-conference/workshops-and-sessions/), held on April, 17th 2023. During the workshop we attempted to give a full description of what a modern thesis could look like for a PhD student in agriculture, incorporating data intensive techniques, with an emphasis on AI based methodologies.

## Requirements
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Create an environment with: keras, geopandas, scikit-learn, and pandas.
- This [recording](https://lsu.zoom.us/rec/share/yIVHpkPC9VRb4UD_N3qkiGdScswGORQfs0A_GGSnhhtE54v8smLbC9HcvXbkYK-a.nrQ37ChG8e8jhj5o?startTime=1681557241000) might help you during the process above.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can either clone this repository(preferable) or download the ZIP file and unzip on your computer. Once you have the files, you can follow the instructions below to run the codes:

Datasets
This repository contains sample datasets that were used during the workshop. These datasets are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any other purpose. They were generated using real values, but they are synthetic.

## Code
This repository contains the following codes:
- 001_Comparison_TG - Comparison between Neural Networks, Random Forests and Linear Regression (main code)
- 001_GDD_LS - Code to calculate Growing Degree Days (GDD).
- 001_HyperparameterRF_LS - Tunning the Random Forest's hyperparameters.
- 001_HypTimeCounts_LS - Code to visualize a bar graph with the mode of Hyperparameter, using the most prevalent value as the best choice.
- 001_JoinDatasets_LS - Gather all the csv datasets in a final one "FullData.csv" - This is a data merging code.
- 001_SSURGO_LS - How to get information from a shapefile with lat and long (point) - A code to analyze SSURGO based data.

## Zoom Recordings:
We attempted to record the presentation and code description during the conference. Although not ideal, these two recordings can help you piece together the presentation:
