# Material for The Artificial Inteligence in Orlando, FL 2023
 
This repository contains the code and sample (fake) datasets used in the "PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP: AI IN AGRICULTURE: LET'S WRITE A MODERN THESIS!", held on April, 17th 2023. The workshop was focused on present a full description of what a modern thesis could look like for a PhD student in agriculture, incorporating data intensive techniques, with an emphasis on AI based methodologies.

## Requirements
- Anaconda
- Create an environment with: keras, geopandas, scikitlearn, pandas, 

## Getting Started
To get started, you can either clone this repository or download the ZIP file. Once you have the files, you can follow the instructions below to run the code:

Datasets
This repository contains sample datasets that were used during the workshop. These datasets are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any other purpose. They were generated using real values, but it's NOT real.

## Code
This repository contains the following code:
-001_Comparison_TG - Comparison between Neural Networks, Random Forests and Linear Regression.
-001_GDD_LS - How to calculate Growing Degree Days (GDD).
-001_HyperparameterRF_LS - Tunning Random Forest's hyperparameters.
-001_HypTimeCounts_LS - Code to visualize a bar graph with the mode of Hyperparameter, you will use the most voted value as you best choice.
-001_JoinDatasets_LS - Gather the all the csv datasets in a final one "FullData.csv" - This code fits how we create the folder structure here.
-001_SSURGO_LS - How to get information from a shapefile with lat and long (point). My goal here is to initialize how to access geospatial data.

## Credits
The code in this repository was created by Dr. Thanos Gentimis and Leticia Santos. If you use this code or the sample datasets, please cite the following paper: (Submitted)
