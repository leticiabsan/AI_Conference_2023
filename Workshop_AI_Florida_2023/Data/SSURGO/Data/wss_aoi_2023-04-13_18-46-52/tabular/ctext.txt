This component is on Mississippi River and former channels, distributaries natural levees, Mississippi River, former channels, distributaries meander belts. The parent material consists of silty alluvium. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 33 inches during January, February, March, April, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent. This component is in the F131AY503LA Delta Plain - Somewhat Poorly Drained Bottomland Hardwoods, Tensas Basin - Somewhat Poorly Drained Bottomland Hardwoods ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 1 percent.
