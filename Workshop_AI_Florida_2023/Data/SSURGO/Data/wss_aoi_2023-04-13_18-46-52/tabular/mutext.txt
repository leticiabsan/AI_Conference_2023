|"Nontechnical description"|"AGR"|"048"|"The potential for cropland and pastureland is excellent. Suitable crops are cotton, soybeans, corn, grain sorghum, and truck crops. Pasture plants are bermudagrasses, bahiagrass and ryegrass. The clay content in the surface layer restricts the use of farm equipment during wet periods. A drainage system is needed to remove excess surface water. Crop residue management will help reduce erosion. Most crops, respond well to nitrogen fertilizers. Lime and other fertilizers generally are not needed."|"1451374"|"2502852"
|"Nontechnical description"|"SOI"|"056"|"This nearly level, somewhat poorly drained soil is on alluvial plains. It is loamy throughout and has high fertility. Runoff is slow, and water and air move moderately slowly through the soil. A seasonal high water table is about 1.5 to 4 feet below the surface during December through April. The shrink-swell potential is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent."|"1451374"|"2502853"
|"Nontechnical description"|"WDS"|"003"|"These are moderately wet, loamy soils with a very high potential for productivity. Equipment limitations are moderate due primarily to excess water. These soils are best suited for southern hardwoods. Site index for green ash is 80-100, cottonwood 100-120, oaks 90-110, and sweetgum 110."|"1451374"|"2502854"

|"Nontechnical description"|"AGR"|"053"|"The potential for cropland and pastureland is good. Suitable crops are soybeans and cotton. Pasture plants are common bermudagrass, bahiagrass, ryegrass, tall fescue and white clover. These soils can be worked only within a narrow range of moisture content. A drainage system is needed. Land grading and smoothing will improve drainage. Most crops respond well to fertilizers. Lime may be needed."|"1451375"|"2502814"
|"Nontechnical description"|"SOI"|"370"|"These are nearly level to undulating, well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils in high and intermediate positions on natural levees on flood plains. The Robinsonville soils are on low ridges, and the Convent soils are in shallow swales. The soils are subject to occasional flooding and to scouring and deposition. Natural fertility is high. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. Both soils have a seasonal high water table at shallow to moderate depths during winter and spring."|"1451375"|"2502815"
|"Nontechnical description"|"WDS"|"001"|"These are well drained, loamy soils with a very high potential for productivity. There are no serious management problems. These soils are best suited for bottomland hardwoods. Site index for green ash is 90, cottonwood 110, sweetgum 100-110, and oaks 90."|"1451375"|"2502816"
