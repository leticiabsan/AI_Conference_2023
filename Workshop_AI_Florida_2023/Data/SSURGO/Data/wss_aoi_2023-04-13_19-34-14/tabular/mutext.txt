|"Nontechnical description"|"AGR"|"047"|"The potential for cropland and pastureland is excellent. Suitable crops are cotton, soybeans, corn, and grain sorghum. Pasture plants are bermudagrasses, bahiagrass, ryegrass tall fescue, and white clover. Traffic pans develop easily, but can be broken by chiseling or deep plowing. A drainage system is generally needed to remove excess surface water. Crop residue management will reduce erosion. Most crops respond well to nitrogen fertilizers. Lime and other fertilizers generally are not needed."|"609759"|"2462240"
|"Nontechnical description"|"AGR"|"048"|"The potential for cropland and pastureland is excellent. Suitable crops are cotton, soybeans, corn, grain sorghum, and truck crops. Pasture plants are bermudagrasses, bahiagrass and ryegrass. The clay content in the surface layer restricts the use of farm equipment during wet periods. A drainage system is needed to remove excess surface water. Crop residue management will help reduce erosion. Most crops, respond well to nitrogen fertilizers. Lime and other fertilizers generally are not needed."|"609759"|"2462241"
|"Nontechnical description"|"SOI"|"056"|"This nearly level, somewhat poorly drained soil is on alluvial plains. It is loamy throughout and has high fertility. Runoff is slow, and water and air move moderately slowly through the soil. A seasonal high water table is about 1.5 to 4 feet below the surface during December through April. The shrink-swell potential is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent."|"609759"|"2462242"
|"Nontechnical description"|"WDS"|"003"|"These are moderately wet, loamy soils with a very high potential for productivity. Equipment limitations are moderate due primarily to excess water. These soils are best suited for southern hardwoods. Site index for green ash is 80-100, cottonwood 100-120, oaks 90-110, and sweetgum 110."|"609759"|"2462243"
